"""
UI response builder — the seam between a normalized tool result and the
final JSON-RPC serialization done by protocol.py.

Owns: the decision of whether a tool call should carry UI metadata, and the
shape of that metadata. Never touches the normalized envelope itself.
See docs/mcp-ui-architecture.md Part 4A (layer ownership) and Part 5A
(this abstraction, with rationale).

Multi-client support: rather than picking one UI convention, this emits
BOTH the OpenAI Apps SDK convention (_meta["openai/outputTemplate"]) and a
generic MCP-UI-style convention (_meta["ui"]["resourceUri"]) pointing at the
same resource. Per MCP Core, _meta is an arbitrary dict and unknown keys
must be ignored by conformant clients — so a client that only understands
one convention simply ignores the other key. This avoids branching on
client identity server-side (which Part 6 of the architecture doc found
has no reliable signal anyway).
